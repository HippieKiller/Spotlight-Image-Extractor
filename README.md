Spotlight Image Extractor v2.00 - by Neil Hippiekiller
=

This program extracts the beautiful lockscreen images from Windows 10/11 to a folder so you can use them as background images for Windows desktop.

Usage:
  Simply run the exe at any time to extract the current lockscreen background images

  Or, if you would prefer the images to be extracted automatically, use this (once):

    Spotlight-Image-Extractor.exe -INSTALL

  And, to stop it extracting images automatically, use:

    Spotlight-Image-Extractor.exe -UNINSTALL



All extracted images are saved to a folder named Spotlight-Images which is located in your **My Documents** folder

All image files are hashed with SHA256 when extacting to avoid duplicates


  Double-click **".\build\compile.bat"** to compile the exe into the build directory
  
  Nothing needs to be installed to compile it, the compiler comes with Windows 10/11
